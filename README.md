# ADM-Homework_1

This repository contains all the files required for the submission of the Homework 1. Specifically, it includes:
1. **Submissions_HackerRank.pdf**, a PDF document that merges all the screenshots of the submissions for the exercises;
2. **scripts.ipynb**, a Jupyter Notebook where each cell contains one exercise. All exercises are organized and divided into sections for Problem 1 and Problem 2.
